# Hotel Booking EDA Project
Project Overview
This project involves developing a predictive model to assess the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations. It utilizes Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data exploration and visualization. The analysis helps in uncovering key trends and patterns to inform business decisions and improve booking predictability.

Objectives
To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking datasets.
To uncover key trends and patterns that inform business decisions.
To develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations.
To improve booking predictability by 25%.
Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from kaggle. The dataset includes information on booking details, customer demographics, cancellation status, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA process involved:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Data Exploration: Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that highlight peak booking seasons, guest preferences, and other key trends.
Insights: Identifying patterns that can help inform business decisions, such as factors influencing booking cancellations and peak booking periods.

Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and modeling.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
